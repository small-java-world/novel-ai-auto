# Coverage Reports

This directory centralises code coverage evidence for TASK-080 and related quality gates.

## Latest Summary
- [2025-09-19 Summary](./20250919-summary.md)

## Usage
- Generate coverage locally with `npm run test:coverage` (see `vitest.config.ts`).
- Export the resulting `coverage/coverage-summary.json` and `coverage/lcov-report/` artefacts.
- Create a dated summary file named `<YYYYMMDD>-summary.md` that captures the latest metrics and deltas.
- Update `docs/tasks/novelai-auto-generator-tasks.md` to link the newest summary.

## Follow-up Actions
- [ ] Align CI artefact upload (`coverage/lcov-report/index.html`).
- [ ] Review new uncovered lines > 10.
```

## Housekeeping
- Keep the latest summary linked from this README once reports accumulate.
- Remove or archive historical files only after copying their key deltas into a changelog.
- Do not commit the raw `coverage/` artefactsâ€”only the distilled markdown summaries.
